# C Practice Project

## Intro

This repository is a compilation of C programs I'm writing as I learn the fundamentals of the **C programming language**.

- I'm currently following a **Udemy course on C** as my primary resource.
- In addition to course exercises, I've also created original programs to experiment with combining multiple concepts.

### Focus Areas So Far

- Control structures
- Functions
- Loops
- User input/output
- Basic logic and problem-solving
- Modular code structure
